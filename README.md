# Hero Guess Game
## Deployed to: https://dmryan711.github.io/HeroGuessGame/
## What the project does:
* The game pulls in some random superheros and displays the image of the hero. 
* The users job is to user their keyboard to type their guesses.
* *On a correct guess:*
  * The game will fill in all of the correct letters for the key entered. (Regardless of upper or lower case)
* *On an incorrect guess:*
  * The game will log an incorrect entry and reduce the remaining guesses by 1
  * If the user tries an inverse case of whatever their original incorrect key-case, the game will ignore as expected
* Once the user guesses all of the heros, the game will start over
